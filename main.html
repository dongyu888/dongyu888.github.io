Dr. Dong Yu is an IEEE Fellow and an ACM distinguished scientist. He is currently taking the role of a distinguished scientist and vice general manager at Tencent AI Lab. Prior to joining Tencent America in 2017, he was a principal researcher at the speech and dialog research group, Microsoft Research (Redmond), Microsoft, where he joined in 1998. He holds a Ph.D. degree in computer science from University of Idaho, an MS degree in computer science from Indiana University at Bloomington, an MS degree (with honor) in pattern recognition and intelligent control from Chinese Academy of Sciences, and a BS degree (with honor) in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University. 

Dr. Dong Yu's research has been focusing on speech processing and recognition, multi-modal interactive systems, and recently natural language processing. He has published 2 monographs and over 250 papers in these areas and is the inventor/coinventor of 100+ granted/pending patents. Dr. Yu's works have been cited for over 30k times with an h-index of 65+ per Google Scholar, and have been recognized by the prestigious IEEE Signal Processing Society (SPS) 2013 and 2016 best paper awards, the ACMSE 2005 best paper award, and the 2017 MLSP best student paper award.

Dr. Dong Yu has developed many techniques over the years, including the recent work on cocktail party problem and multi-modal interactive systems. His most significant contribution to the field is the development of CD-DNN-HMM, the first successful application of the deep learning techniques to large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR). This disruptive work caused a paradigm shift for LVCSR, both in industry and the research community, led to a series of significant advancements in the field. 

Dr. Dong Yu is currently serving as the vice chair of the IEEE Speech and Language Processing Technical Committee (SLPTC) and technical co-chair of ICASSP 2021. He has served as a member of the IEEE SLPTC (2013-2018, two terms), a distinguished lecturer of APSIPA (2017-2018), an associate editor of the IEEE/ACM transactions on audio, speech, and language processing (TASLP) (2011-2015), an associate editor of the IEEE signal processing magazine (2008-2011), an associate editor of the ACM transactions on Asian and low resource language information processing (2017-2019), the lead guest editor of the IEEE TASLP - special issue on deep learning for speech and language processing (2010-2011), a guest editor of the IEEE/CAA journal of automatica sinica - special issue on deep learning in audio, image, and text processing (2015-2016), and members of organization and technical committees of many conferences and workshops.
