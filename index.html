    <h2>Short Bio</h2>

        <p>Dr. Dong Yu is an ACM/IEEE/ISCA Fellow. He currently works at Tencent AI Lab as a distinguished scientist and vice general manager. Before joining Tencent America in 2017, he was a principal researcher at Microsoft Research (Redmond), Microsoft, where he had been since 1998. He holds a Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of Idaho, an MS degree in computer science from Indiana University at Bloomington, an MS degree (with honor) in pattern recognition and intelligent control from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and a BS degree (with honor) in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University. </p>

        <p>Dr. Dong Yu was known for his pioneering work in speech recognition and deep learning. His research spans speech processing and recognition, multi-modal interactive and agentic systems, and natural language processing (including large language models), using deep learning techniques.  He has two monographs and over 400 papers to his credit. His work has been widely cited. He is an honored recipient of the 2025 IEEE SPS Claude Shannon-Harry Nyquist Technical Achievement Award, the 2013, 2016, 2020, and 2022 IEEE Signal Processing Society Best Paper Award, the 2021 NAACL Best Long Paper Award, the 2022 IEEE Signal Processing Magazine Best Paper Award, the 2022 IEEE Signal Processing Magazine Best Column Award, and the EMNLP 2023 Outstanding Paper Award. </p>

        <p>Dr. Dong Yu has served in the IEEE Speech and Language Processing Technical Committee (SLPTC) (member 2013-2018, vice-chair 2020, chair 2021-2022). He has also served as a distinguished industry speaker of IEEE (2026-2027), a distinguished speaker of ACM (2023-2025), a distinguished lecturer of APSIPA (2017-2018), an associate editor (AE) ( 2011-2015) and senior area editor (2025-2027)  of the IEEE/ACM transactions on audio, speech, and language processing (TASLP) (2011-2015), an associate editor of the IEEE signal processing magazine (2008-2011), an associate editor of the ACM transactions on Asian and low resource language information processing (2017-2019), the lead guest editor of the IEEE TASLP - special issue on deep learning for speech and language processing (2010-2011), a guest editor of the IEEE/CAA journal of automatica sinica - special issue on deep learning in audio, image, and text processing (2015-2016), and members of the organization and technical committees of many conferences and workshops, including technical co-chair of ICASSP 2021. </p>
